  description: Encoding of read and write accessibility of CSRs based on privilege
    level
  type: implementation-specific
  constraints:
  - 12-bit encoding space for up to 4,096 CSRs
  - Top 4 bits (csr[11:8]) encode read/write accessibility and lowest privilege level
  - Top 2 bits (csr[11:10]) indicate read/write (00, 01, 10) or read-only (11) access
  - Next 2 bits (csr[9:8]) encode the lowest privilege level that can access the CSR

    for read/write accessibility and minimal privilege level
  type: optional
  constraints: If followed, csr[11:10] = 00, 01, or 10 indicates read/write; =11 indicates
    read-only; csr[9:8] encodes lowest privilege level allowed to access CSR.

  constraints: The 12-bit CSR address space (csr[11:0]) is fixed by the ISA, but the
    encoding of accessibility in bits [11:8] is only conventional and not mandated.
    Implementations may use alternative encodings or omit this convention.

- name: cache_organization
  description: 'The structural organization of a cache (e.g., direct‑mapped, set‑associative)
    that determines how blocks are mapped to sets or ways.

  description: 'The size of each cache block, which represents a contiguous, naturally
    aligned power‑of‑two (or NAPOT) range of memory locations.

  type: implementation-specific
  constraints:
  - Must be a contiguous, naturally aligned power-of-two (NAPOT) range of memory locations.

  description: Software-accessible method (e.g., CSR, memory-mapped register, HSM,
    or OS interface) to query cache parameters
  type: implementation-specific
  constraints: The execution environment *must* provide such a mechanism ("provides
    software a means to discover"); but the mechanism itself is not standardized in
    this spec excerpt

  description: Whether cache blocks map to contiguous, naturally aligned power-of-two
    (NAPOT) ranges or other range types
  type: optional
  constraints: The spec explicitly allows "power-of-two (or NAPOT)" — suggesting NAPOT
    is one valid option among others (though not elaborated here); no requirement
    to support both

  description: How a cache block is identified — specifically, whether identification
    uses any physical address in the block
  type: implementation-specific
  constraints: Must allow identification by *any* physical address in the block; no
    restriction on internal tagging scheme
